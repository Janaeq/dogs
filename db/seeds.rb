# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:

#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

walker1 = Walker.create(name: "Andy", bio: "Hi there! I'm a student at Furry University studying Animal Science. In my free time I love spending time with big and small dogs alike! I am certified in animal first aid, so I am always prepared if your little (or big!!) one ever needs special attention. Can't wait to meet your furry friend!")
walker2 = Walker.create(name: "Currile", bio: "I was never a dog lover until I rescued my little baby Tiger! Ever since, I have grown a passion for hanging with dogs. In my free time I am studying for my Medical College Admission Test, so hanging with your pets give me much needed stress relief! Some hobbies I have are reading, journaling, and collecting candles :)")
walker3 = Walker.create(name: "Amber", bio: "Puppies are my passion! I love playing with them, taking them for a walk, and learning new things about their individual personalities! I have a toy yorkie of my own, and have grown up with dogs my entire life! I hope to be able to meet your puppies soon!")
walker4 = Walker.create(name: "Michael", bio: "I'm a gamer, but you'll never catch me on the console without my 3 dogs next to me. They bring me so much joy! Eventually when I do step away from the game, I love getting my exercise in with your pups. I'll never say no to a new furry friend!")
